# LIFE-EXPECTANCY-ANALYSIS

#**Executive Summary**
Between 2000 and 2015, global life expectancy rose from 66.9 to 71.5 years; a gain of 4.6 years in just one and a half decades. Developing countries achieved the fastest progress (+5.1 years) while developed nations added a more modest +3.2 years. Despite convergence, a persistent 11-year gap remains between the two groups in 2015.
The strongest predictors of longer life are not wealth alone, but years of schooling, income equality, low adult mortality, and high immunization coverage. Countries that combine moderate economic growth with strong public health and education systems (e.g., Cuba, Viet Nam) consistently outperform wealthier peers.

#**Objectives**
1.  Quantify global and regional life expectancy progress (2000–2015).
2.  Identify the most powerful drivers of longevity.
3.  Highlight disparities and success stories.
4.  Deliver an interactive, boardroom-ready Power BI dashboard.
5.  Provide evidence-based policy recommendations aligned with SDG 3.

#**Methodology**
•  Dataset: 2,938 country-year observations (193 countries, WHO & World Bank).
•  Platform: Microsoft Power BI Desktop.
•  Transformations: Data type correction, blank imputation (column averages), creation of GDP per capita and regional groupings.
•  Analytics: Correlation analysis, time-series decomposition, DAX measures for YoY change and benchmarking.

|   2      |  Developing countries closed the gap slightly                |   Gap narrowed from 13.2 to 11.3 years             |
|   3      |  Adult mortality remains the most powerful negative driver   |   r=0.90                                           |

|   5      |  High immunization coverage (95%) adds 7-10 years on average |   Polio/Diphtheria/HepB coverage                   |

|   7      |  Lowest performance (2015)                                   |   Sierra Leone 50.1,Angola 52.4                    |

#**Recommendations**
1.  Accelerate universal education;every additional year of schooling yields 3–4 years of life expectancy.
2.  Achieve and sustain >95% immunization coverage for six core vaccines.
3.  Renew focus on adult mortality and HIV/AIDS in high-burden regions.
4.  Scale the “high-impact primary care” model proven in Cuba and Costa Rica.
5.  Target middle-income transition countries ($5k–$15k GDP per capita) for rapid gains.

#**Conclusion**
The first 15 years of the 21st century proved that rapid, large-scale improvements in human longevity are possible. The roadmap is clear: combine sustained investment in education and basic healthcare with targeted disease control and equitable growth.
This Power BI dashboard transforms complex global health data into an intuitive, interactive tool for decision-makers enabling real-time exploration, benchmarking, and evidence-based planning for a longer, healthier future for all.
